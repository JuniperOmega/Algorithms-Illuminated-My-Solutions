# Algorithms-Illuminated-My-Solutions

I am following along a book series by Tim Roughgarden, based on online courses that are currently running on the Coursera and Stanford Lagunita platforms. This documentation highlights my take on the algorithms written in the first series of a four-part series, for Algorithms Illuminated Part 1: The basics

## Description

My programming solutions are written in C++ using Windows 10 Ubuntu Bash Shell. Each of the topics I cover will include various ways to code the algorithm. The various algorithms/topics covered include: asymptotic analysis, big-O notation, divide-and-conquer algorithms, the master method, randomized algorithms, and several famous algorithms for sorting and selection.

## Setup
To run any of these files, install it locally on your machine. Feel free to run and compile the programs on your favorite IDE or terminal.
If you would like to install Ubuntu on Windows 10 please follow the link below:

```
Once your setup is complete and configured. Download and save the file to a directory. If you would like to create your directory right from the bash shell then please follow the instructions below:

```
type "mkdir [directory_name]" on the command prompt to create your directory

$ mkdir algorithms

Be aware that the directory will be created in the current working directory 
```
